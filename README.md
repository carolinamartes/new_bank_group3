# New Bank - Software Engineering 2 Group Project

NewBank is an idea for a new disrupter bank where customers can interact with their accounts via a simple command-line interface.

## Getting Started

To interact with the New Bank interface, you'll have to run both NewBankServer.java and ExampleClient.java.

## Features

Customers can interact with the bank by using any of the following commands:

* SENDMONEY
* SHOWMYACCOUNTS
* MOVEMYMONEY
* WITHDRAW
* DEPOSIT
* NEWMAIN
* NEWSAVING
* NEWCHECKING
* CLOSEACCOUNT
* LOGOUT
* CHANGEPASSWORD


Password authentication- Clients can now log into NewBank using their username and password.<br>
Changing Passwords- Clients now have the functionality to update their password in NewBank.<br>
logOut- Clients can log out of Example Client upon completion of their session.<br>
Catching Password null loops- After three incorrect password entries, example client will now automatically close in order to prevent further password attempts from a user.<br>
Printing Account Balances to text – Clients can now print their Account balances to a local saved text file (works on both Windows and Mac OS).

Employees can interact with the bank by using any of the following commands:

* CREATEACCOUNT
* CREATECUSTOMER
* LOGOUT
